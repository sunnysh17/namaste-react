Hook is just a normal js function with specific function

useEffect(callbackfunc,dependencyarr)
callback function will be called after our component renders

Whenever we change a local state Variables react re-renders the entire component.

Whenever the state Variables updates, react triggers the reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)
